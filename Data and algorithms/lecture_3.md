# Storage Structure (Array)

### Array is a Data Structure.


## Data Structure 

- The logical or mathematical model of a particular organization of data


## Storage Structure

- Representation of a particular data structure in the memory of a computer

-----------

## There are many possible storage structure to a particular data structure
 - Ex: There are a number of storage structure for a data structure such as array

 Note: Its possible for two DS to represented by the same storage structure


 # Array

 Array is a collection of items that are stored conductively in the memory 
 Lets say we have this representation of the memory with each block represent a slot in memory

 - We cant use diffrent array types


-------


# Why not Mixed Types

## Memory representation

# Array operations

- **Accessing** an element in array
- **Inserting** an element at index
- **Deleting** an element an array
- **Serching** an element in array
- **Sorting** an array


# Accesing an element in array

Traversal: Processing each element in the list search: finding the location of the elenent with a given value or the

Algorithmic Complexity: O(n)

# Deleting an element in array

Deletion: Removing an element from the list

Algorithmic Complexity: O(n)


# Searching an element in array

Traversal: Finding the location of the element with a given value or the record with a given key

Algorithmic Complexity: O(n)

# Sorting an array

- **Counting Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- Stable/Unstable sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort


---------------

# Counting Sort 

- Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a spesific range. It works by counting the number of object having distnict key values (kind of hashing)
